# Aloysius_Portfolio
Welcome to my projects portfolio! Here, you will find summaries of the projects I have embarked on along with the links to direct you to the repository should you be interested to know more. Thank you for visiting!

## Main projects
### [Project 1: Fragrance Popularity Analysis](https://github.com/Loyloyy/Fragrance_Popularity_Analysis)
* Wrote a Selenium web crawler to scrape and parse unstructured HTML data to compare attributed popularity (e.g. release date, brand, perfume accords, longevity, and silage)
#### Coming Soon! <Estimated June 2020>
* Uncover insights between perfume's popularity scraped information
* Create a recommendation system to allow for users to find similar perfumes of their liking
* Deploy models onto web for users to use


### [Project 2: Hotel Cancellation Prediction](https://github.com/Loyloyy/Hotel_Cancellation_Prediction)
* Performed in-depth analyses on raw dataset to deepen insights on guest cancellation
* Utilised data cleaning and wrangling and feature engineering to further enhance features 
* Compared multiple supervised ML algorithms' accuracy, achieving 70.6% (XGBoost)
* Tuned a deep learning model to further increase model’s accuracy up to 83.3% (Tensorflow, Pytorch)


### [Project3: Sentiment Analysis using NLTK and Deep Learning](https://github.com/Loyloyy/Sentiment_Analysis)
* Utilised Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and TF-IDF to prepare data
* Compared multiple machine learning algorithms and achieved 61% accuracy (Naïve Bayes)
* Achieved 87% accuracy with an RNN, LSTM model (Tensorflow)

### [Project 4: Fake News Filter](https://github.com/Loyloyy/Fake_News_Filter)
* Trained multiple algorithms to determine a model best suited to filter fake news
* Tuned Passive Aggressive Classifier to achieve 86% accuracy
* Experimented with ensemble learning by combining multiple algorithms (VotingClassifier)



## [Project 5: Final Year Project](https://github.com/Loyloyy/Final_Year_Project)
* Automated data mining and processing procedures, resulting in up to 70% time savings
* Conducted data regression analyses of the relationship between battery health (SoH) and other extracted features
* Built multiple machine learning algorithms to balance accuracy and performance for deployment, including support vector regression (SVR), decision tree, random forest, K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and extreme learning machine, achieving up to an RMSE of 0.09 with KNN
* Utilised PCA for comparison and achieved up to RMSE of 0.13 with KNN
* Proposed methods to deploy models, including one-time, batch and real-time training usingApache Spark and Kafka
